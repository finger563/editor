Editor Tutorial
===============

The editor can be used to create meta-models, view-models and
models. meta-models are the most basic and define the structure that
models based on them can have.  View-models are tied with meta-models
and govern how their models are viewed.

Since the main purpose of the editor is to allow the development of
component-based ROS nodes, the main tutorials here will cover
iterative model development, deployment, and analysis.
